Project aimed at revolutionizing the tourism and cultural heritage sector: Poppin is a cutting-edge web application akin to Yelp, but with a distinct edge. Poppin is designed to leverage the rich Tourism and Cultural Heritage Promotion data of New York City to provide users with unparalleled insights and experiences.
